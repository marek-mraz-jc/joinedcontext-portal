# Záznamy mesta Banská Bystrica / Records of the city of Banská Bystrica

The city's published statistical rows, by the page, with a filter on every column — and one
attribute a person may write. The region's grid, `apps/bbsk-zaznamy`, is the same bundle with its
own manifest.

## Why only one column opens

Every figure of a `StatisticalObservation` is written by a pipeline: `value`, `indicator`,
`refArea`, `refPeriod` and the rest come from the publisher's own table and are replaced on the
next run. A screen that let a person correct one would lose what they typed, silently, the next
time the pipeline ran. So the grid opens `stewardNote` — the one attribute of the model that no
pipeline writes (`statistical-observation` 1.1.0, T-2434) — and the page says out loud why the
numbers cannot be edited.

The narrowing is in three places, and each one is the whole rule on its own:

| where | what it refuses |
|---|---|
| the Policy `mesto-steward-note` | `updateAttrs` on `stewardNote` alone: a PATCH of `value` is the gateway's own 403 |
| `spec.dataNeeds` | one type, one write operation, the listed attributes |
| `records.ts` | the screen sends the note and nothing else, and refuses a note the model would refuse |

## Whose records a screen shows

The same `ui/src` is published twice. Which body's records it shows comes from the space the
served configuration names (`banskabystrica-mesto` → the city, `bbsk-kraj` → the region), and the
endpoint is found in the same document by space and never by position. A configuration naming a
space the application does not know says so instead of guessing — nothing is built for one project,
so the two screens cannot drift apart. `ui/src` of the two apps is byte-identical, and
`tests/reference_apps_tests.rs` holds it that way.

## What a person sees when a write is refused

The write is one `PATCH /api/endpoint/{slug}/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/{id}/attrs` through this
application's own endpoint, carried by the person's own session — the bundle holds no credential
and never sends an `Authorization` header. A refusal is the gateway's own problem document, shown
in its own words beside the row it belongs to, with the typed value kept; nothing reloads and
nothing is retried without the person (AP-40, AP-62).

A note longer than the model's 500 characters, or one holding `<` or `>`, is refused before it is
sent, in the same place a refusal appears. That bound is the model's own
(`^[^<>]{0,500}$`); the gateway does not yet validate writes against a space's published schema
(DM-27), so today this is where it holds.

## No history, on purpose

The steward's grant is `retrieveOps` and `updateAttrs` (T-2434). It reaches no temporal
operation, so the grid's history is switched off rather than offered as a button that answers 403.

## Building it

```sh
cd ui
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build
pnpm e2e
```

`pnpm e2e` serves the built bundle under `/apps/banskabystrica-zaznamy/` with the static host's
Content Security Policy and the fixture endpoint, and holds the records and a note under review to
375, 768, 1440 and 2560 px: no sideways scroll, no overlapping blocks, no control cut off, axe clean
(T-2825).
