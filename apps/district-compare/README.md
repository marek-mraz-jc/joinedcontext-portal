# Compare districts

Helsinki districts compared side by side: events, bike stations, alerts, and air quality:

- a choropleth map of all Helsinki districts coloured by the chosen measure (default: events per km²);
- the two districts with the most events preselected on arrival;
- side-by-side comparison table showing each selected district's values, values per km² (where applicable), and ranking among all districts;
- bar chart for the chosen measure across the selected districts;
- ranked district list allowing selection via checkboxes or directly on the map;
- URL hash keeping the active selection and measure (`#compare?d=101,102&m=events`).

Finnish, English or Swedish (`?lang=fi|en|sv`, else the browser's language), switched in the SDK's `AppShell` (SDK-39), with the SDK's loading, empty and error states. Light and dark themes follow the reader's system.

A district picked on the map joins the comparison and opens in the SDK's entity panel (SDK-40); each compared district has its Details button. The App is public and writes nothing, so the panel links the district to the Portal and offers no Edit (AP-140).

## How it is built

A `wasm` App (AP-142, AP-148): React on the joinedcontext App SDK for the page, spatial point-in-polygon and ranking analysis in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly and run in a Web Worker in the visitor's browser, and a server component on the shared WASM host for what the browser cannot keep (T-3353).

- `wasm/` is the crate: `geo.rs` (point-in-polygon, geometry area in km², bounding boxes, representative coordinate extraction) and `lib.rs` (`compare`: JSON in, JSON out, computing district aggregates, per-km² rates, rankings, and points falling outside districts).
- `src/compare.worker.ts` loads the module once and answers each call; `src/compare.ts` is the page's side of it.
- Reads `CityDistrict` (`divisionLevel = "district"`), `Event`, `BikeHireDockingStation`, `Alert`, and `AirQualityObserved` in the Context Space `helsinki`.
- `server/` is the server component (`wasm32-wasip2`, on `jc-app-sdk`), reusing `wasm/` without wasm-bindgen. Once a day on Helsinki's calendar it reads the same five types through the App's own Endpoint with the reader's token, runs the same comparison and keeps every district's figures for that day in its table `district_metrics` (`migrations/`), so a district has a history; it also writes the boundaries it compared against as `boundaries/districts.geojson`, with `boundaries/LICENCE.txt` (CC BY 4.0, City of Helsinki, HRI package helsingin-piirijako), under the App's storage prefix. The page shows the selected districts' days for the chosen measure and downloads both files through presigned URLs.

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET /apps/district-compare/api/metrics?codes=101,102` | the kept days of up to six districts, the newest first |
| `GET /apps/district-compare/api/boundaries` | URLs to download the boundaries and their licence from |

## Roles and history

A signed-in reader keeps comparisons of their own (T-3828): a name, up to six districts and a measure, at most 20. They open, update or delete their own, and share one by its link (`?comparison=<id>`), which any signed-in reader of the project opens read-only with its owner named. A steward pins the comparison on screen for everyone: the page opens on the newest pin unless its address names districts or a shared comparison; taking a pin back returns to the one before. Every change shows at once and is taken back when the server refuses; the server records each in `app_audit`, and the Changes page lists a viewer's own and a steward's every one. Roles come from the caller's token through `identity::caller()`, never from the page.

| Route | Who | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /apps/district-compare/api/me` | anyone | the caller's name and roles, `null` when signed out |
| `GET /apps/district-compare/api/comparisons` | signed in | the caller's comparisons, newest first |
| `POST /apps/district-compare/api/comparisons` `{name, codes, measure}` | signed in | a comparison kept |
| `GET /apps/district-compare/api/comparisons/{id}` | signed in | any comparison, read-only, with its owner's name |
| `PUT /apps/district-compare/api/comparisons/{id}` | owner | changed |
| `DELETE /apps/district-compare/api/comparisons/{id}` | owner | gone |
| `GET /apps/district-compare/api/default` | anyone | the pinned comparison, `null` when none |
| `PUT /apps/district-compare/api/default` `{name, codes, measure}` | steward | pinned for everyone |
| `DELETE /apps/district-compare/api/default` | steward | the newest pin taken back |
| `GET /apps/district-compare/api/history` | signed in | the newest 100 changes (a viewer: their own) |

The groups `district-compare-viewer` and `district-compare-steward` (`grants/users/groups/`) hold the demo viewer and steward. The App writes no context data, so its Endpoint's Policy stays read-only.

## Run the tests

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm wasm          # cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown, then wasm-bindgen --target web
(cd wasm && cargo test)
(cd server && cargo test && cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip2)
pnpm test          # vitest, with the compiled module run in-process
pnpm build
pnpm e2e           # the built bundle in Chromium: 4 widths, light and dark, fi and en, axe
```

`pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build` import `wasm/pkg/`, so `pnpm wasm` runs first; the build lane runs it as `builder/build-wasm.sh` (T-3327).
The build needs the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and `wasm-bindgen-cli` 0.2.129, the version the
crate pins.
