# Ovzdušie v Banskej Bystrici / Air quality in Banská Bystrica

One screen over the city's `ovzdusie` space: the measuring stations on a map, coloured by their
latest PM10 against the daily limit, and one day of history for the station a reader picks. It
reads and never writes, and it never asks anybody to sign in.

## Why staleness is a band and not a footnote

A station that stops reporting keeps its last number. Drawn by that number alone, a station that
fell silent this morning at 9 µg/m³ is the greenest dot on the map, and a reader takes it for the
cleanest air in the city. So `bandOf` decides staleness **before** the thresholds: a reading older
than three hours is `stale`, in its own grey, with the words "staré meranie" on the card. The
number is still shown — it is real, it is just not about now.

The thresholds are Directive 2008/50/EC as `docs/Development/11` §2 quotes it: PM10 elevated from
35 µg/m³ and above the limit from 50 µg/m³. What is judged is the station's latest reading and not
a daily mean, and the screen says so.

## What it reads

One endpoint, one space, one type:

| what | where |
|---|---|
| space | `ovzdusie` of the project `banskabystrica` |
| endpoint | `public-air`, audience `public` |
| type | `AirQualityObserved` |
| attributes | `dateObserved`, `location`, `observedAt`, `pm10`, `pm25` |
| operations | `queryEntity`, `retrieveEntity`, `queryTemporal` |

The attributes are exactly the five the space's public grant serves. `reliability` and `refDevice`
are operational and the public grant does not reach them, so asking for them would put a refusal
into every answer (`policy-public-read.yaml`).

**No login and no token.** The endpoint is public, so the bundle holds no credential and the
browser sends none; `App.test.tsx` asserts that no request carries an `Authorization` header
(AP-28). The endpoint is found in the served configuration by **space**, never by position.

## The map is a picture of the list

A canvas is not readable by a screen reader and cannot be reached by the keyboard, so the map is
`role="img"` with a name, and the same stations are a list beside it: name, band in words and in a
shape, both numbers, and when the reading was taken. Picking a station from the list or from the
map is the same action. A station that publishes no location is on the list with a line saying it
is not on the map, because leaving it off both would hide a station that exists.

The basemap is the keyless OpenStreetMap raster tile service with its attribution, so the screen
runs on a cluster with no map account and no key in any manifest.

## What is the application's own, and what is the publisher's

The published model (`bb-air-quality.linkml.yaml`) has no `name` slot, so a station has no name to
show. The screen calls it after the `{localId}` of its own URN — `station-1` reads "Stanica 1" —
rather than inventing a name no publisher stands behind. The bands and the staleness rule are the
application's own and are stated on the page.

## Building it

```sh
cd ui
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build
pnpm e2e
```

`pnpm e2e` serves the built bundle under `/apps/banskabystrica-ovzdusie/` with the static host's
Content Security Policy and the fixture endpoint, and holds the stations and a picked station to a
phone, a tablet, a laptop and a wall (375, 768, 1440, 2560 px): no sideways scroll, no overlapping
blocks, axe clean at WCAG 2.1 AA (T-2825).

`@joinedcontext/sdk` is linked from this repository, which is why `vite.config.ts` dedupes React.
