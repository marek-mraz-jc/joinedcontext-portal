# air-quality

The reference app of AP-34: the stations of one Context Space, their latest values, a day of
history, and a record form for a steward: add a station, correct its name, position and note,
remove a station a steward added. The measured values stay read-only. Architecture in
[Apps on Demand §6 and §13](https://github.com/marek-mraz-jc/joinedcontext-docs/blob/main/Architecture/16-apps-on-demand.md).

The roles come from the Portal's `GET {JC_ME_URL}`, asked with the edge's token (AP-109); they
decide what the page offers. What a person may write is decided by the gateway against the
App's per-role grants, and its refusal reaches the page word for word (AP-40).

It reaches exactly one thing, the Endpoint whose URL it is handed, and it holds no credential
of its own. The login in front of it is the platform edge (APISIX `openid-connect`), which
hands the user over as `X-Userinfo` and the user's access token as `X-Access-Token`; the app
carries that token to the endpoint and shows whatever comes back, refusal included. It has no
login, session or token code of its own, and a write without `X-Access-Token` is a 401 (AP-40).

## Run it

```bash
JC_ENDPOINT_URL=https://{host}/api/endpoint/{slug}/ \
JC_BASE_PATH=/apps/air-quality/ \
JC_ME_URL=https://{host}/api/v1/projects/{project}/apps/air-quality/me \
JC_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8080 \
cargo run -p air-quality
```

`JC_ENDPOINT_URL` is the only required variable (without `JC_ME_URL` nobody holds a role, so
nobody gets the form); in the pod the reconciler sets
`JC_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8080` and the readiness probe reads `/healthz`. Build the UI first with `pnpm install &&
pnpm build` in `ui/`; a debug build reads `ui/dist` from disk, a release build embeds it.

## Test it

```bash
cargo test -p air-quality                 # the backend and its contract with the endpoint
cd ui && pnpm test                        # the screens
cd ui && pnpm exec playwright test        # the steward and viewer flows against the binary
```

The browser flow starts the real binary against `tests/e2e/stub-endpoint.mjs` and plays the
edge itself, setting the `X-Access-Token` and `X-Userinfo` headers the plugin would set.
