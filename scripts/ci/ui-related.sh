# The UI tests a change reaches (T-6153), for ci.yml's ui job when scripts/ci/changes.sh says
# ui_scope=related: the tests that import a file the change touched (vitest related), the changed
# test files, and every test that reads the tree itself (the gate inventories, the locale and
# control registries), which no import graph names. A deleted or renamed file runs the whole
# suite: what imported it is no longer in any graph. A language catalogue (src/locales/<xx>.json)
# is imported by i18n.ts, which every page reaches, so it stands for the keys it moved instead:
# the sources and tests that name such a key (or its parent before a `${`), and the tests that
# quote a text it changed. ci-full runs the whole suite every day.
#
#   UI_SHARD=1/4 sh scripts/ci/ui-related.sh <base>   run them, that shard of them (ui/ installed)
#   sh scripts/ci/ui-related.sh --list <base> print the vitest arguments only
