# The forge's runner (ADR-N-028 §3.3, AP-81): one ephemeral registration per job, so a job never
# holds a runner credential a later job could use. In host mode a job runs as this same user
# and can read what this user reads (ADR-N-028 §5), so:
#
#   - the organization's registration token is read ONCE from a file the pod's init container
#     copied into memory, and the file is deleted before the first job starts; it lives on only
#     in this shell's unexported variable, which a job cannot read from /proc/<pid>/environ;
#   - it reaches `register` on stdin, never on a command line a job could list;
#   - the ephemeral registration file a job can read is spent by that job, and is deleted with
#     the work directory before the next registration;
#   - every process a job leaves behind is killed before the next registration, so a secret
#     given to a job that runs no application code is out of reach of the jobs before it.
#
#   GITEA_INSTANCE           the forge's in-cluster URL
#   GITEA_RUNNER_TOKEN_FILE  the copied registration token (default /tmp/runner-secret/token)
#   GITEA_RUNNER_NAME        a name prefix (default: the pod's hostname)
#   GITEA_RUNNER_ONCE        1 in an App's build pod (AP-124): register once with that App's
#                            repository token, take one job and end, so the Job completes
