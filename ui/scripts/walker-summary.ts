/**
 * T-4950: the live walker's reports (`walker-steward.json`, `walker-viewer.json`) as the summary
 * `tasks/file-failures` files tasks from, after each portal rollout to dev (UI-01, UI-16).
 *
 *     node scripts/walker-summary.ts <walk dir> <run> [--previous <summary.json>] [--merged T-1,T-2]
 *
 * One result per finding: its key is `<rule> <route> [<label>]`, which the board deduplicates on.
 * The same field without a hint at 1440 and 400 px, for the steward and the viewer, is one key and
 * so one task, and so is every unhinted field of one form (`ruleAndLabel`). The route keeps the section and tab a page belongs to and drops the item a walk
 * happened to open, so a finding keeps its task when the first item of a list changes. A key that failed in the previous run, on a
 * route this run walked, and is gone now is reported as a pass, which closes its task. The tasks
 * merged since the last clean walk are named in each detail: one of them most likely brought it.
