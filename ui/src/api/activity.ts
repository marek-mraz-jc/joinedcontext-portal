 * The tail is the one thing the Portal renders that it did not type: a frame is JSON off an

 * `Intl.DateTimeFormat.format`, which throws `RangeError: Invalid time value` — and with the
 * only error boundary around the whole app, that one frame blanks the Portal (T-2427). So a
 * frame is checked before anything renders it, against what the row actually draws: a `time`
 * `Date` can read, and words where words are printed (an object handed to React as a child
 * throws as surely as a bad date). A field nobody draws — `project`, `correlationId` — is not
 * asked for: the feed is scoped by the request it made, and dropping a readable event over a
 * field that never reaches the screen would hide what the person came to see.
