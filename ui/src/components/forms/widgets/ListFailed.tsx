 * Why a choice is empty: the list could not be asked for (UI-44, T-1502).

 * "there is nothing here yet" against "nobody could ask". One line in the same words everywhere,
 * with the API's own reason and a retry, so a person is not left guessing which of the two it is.
 * The retry is the query's `refetch`, because a failed list is worth one more try before a reload.
