/**
 * T-1807, T-1808: the map's palette, in one place (UI-15).
 *
 * A canvas paints with colour *values*, not classes: MapLibre parses the strings in a paint
 * spec itself and deck.gl wants an RGB triple, so neither can be handed `bg-primary` or a
 * `var(--color-primary)` a browser would resolve. That is why the map was the one surface of
 * the Portal an installation's brand and the dark theme never reached — eight literals written
 * into two components.
 *
 * The chrome the map draws — the ground it falls back to, the outline that keeps a shape legible,
 * the colour a layer takes when it encodes nothing — is read from `tokens.css` at paint time, so
 * it follows the brand and flips with the theme like everything else. The sequential ramp does
 * not: it is a data scale (ColorBrewer YlOrRd, which is what the Layer manifests name), it has to
 * stay readable against the basemap in both themes, and a reader who has learnt that red means
 * "high" must not find it means something else because an installation changed its primary.
 *
 * The literals below are the last resort, for a renderer with no stylesheet — jsdom in the unit
 * tests, a screenshot worker before the CSS lands. A browser resolves the token every time. They
 * are the only colour values left in the `dashboards` folder, and this is their reason.
