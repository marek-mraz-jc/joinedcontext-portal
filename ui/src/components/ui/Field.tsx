/**
 * Label, description, control, help and errors, in that order, with the ids wired so a screen
 * reader hears all of it (UI-01, UI-44).
 *
 * **The Field does the wiring, not the caller.** It used to mint the ids and stamp them on its
 * own paragraphs, leaving each page to reconstruct `${id}__help` by hand and name it in the
 * control's `aria-describedby`. Two of the twenty message-bearing Fields did; the other eighteen
 * rendered help and error text that no screen reader was ever told about — and `aria-invalid`,
 * which is what draws the red border, was the caller's job as well, so a Field with `errors`
 * commonly showed a normal control. Now the Field clones its child and adds what is missing.
 *
 * What the child already carries wins: a control with its own `aria-describedby` keeps it and
 * the Field's ids are appended, and an explicit `aria-invalid` is never overwritten. The
 * control is the caller's — an Input, a Select, a widget of rjsf, whatever the form needs.
 *
 * **A `Fragment` child is not wired, and must not be.** rjsf's `SchemaField` hands
 * `FieldTemplate` a Fragment, and a Fragment takes no props: React keeps `key` and `children`
 * and drops every `aria-*`. Cloning into it instead would land the ids on whatever wrapper the
 * widget happens to render, which is not the control either. Inside a form the wiring is the
 * widget's own job: it names `ariaDescribedByIds(id)`, which is character for character what
 * `fieldIds` mints above, and `tests/contract_widget_describedby.test.tsx` holds the two
 * together and holds every Portal widget to it (T-2314).
