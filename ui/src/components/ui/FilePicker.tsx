/**
 * The one file input of the Portal (UI-01, UI-16).
 *
 * A file input cannot be styled and must not be hidden from the keyboard, so every page that
 * takes a file writes the same three lines: an `sr-only` `<input type="file">` inside a
 * `<label>` that carries the visible trigger. Four pages wrote it by hand, and each drifted —
 * one lost its focus ring, another kept the chosen file in the input so picking the same file
 * twice did nothing the second time.
 *
 * The input keeps its place in the tab order and is reached by `Tab` like any other control;
 * the ring is drawn on the label, because that is what a person sees.
