 * cannot be styled, cannot be translated, names nothing, and blocks the page.
 *
 * Cancel holds the focus when it opens and is the button Enter presses: a dialog that arrives
 * under the pointer must not destroy something because a key was already on its way down. The
 * destructive button says the verb, never "OK", so it reads the same in the dialog as in the menu
 * item that opened it.
 *
 * It is a courtesy, not a control: whatever the person may not do, the server still refuses.
