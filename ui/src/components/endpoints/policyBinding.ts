/**
 * Which `Policy` manifests decide an endpoint's calls (EP-14, GW8, T-2282).
 *
 * The endpoint names its policy as a URN — `urn:ngsi-ld:Policy:{orgDomain}:{spaceSegment}:{name}`
 * — and the page used to show that string and stop there, because nothing in the Portal knew
 * which manifest it stood for. The gateway does know, and its rule is short enough to hold in
 * one function (`context-gateway/src/store.rs`, `bound_policy`):
 *
 * - without `spec.policyRef`, every Policy of the endpoint's space applies — except one assigned
 *   to another Endpoint's role (`endpoint:{project}/{name}[/{role}]`): the gateway drops such a
 *   role from every token and gives a caller only the roles of the Endpoint it came through
 *   (`jc_core::kinds::endpoint_role`, AP-96, AP-97), so another App's grant never applies here;
 * - with one, the Policy of that space whose **manifest name** equals the URN's local id, and
 *   only when the URN's space segment is the endpoint's own space segment;
 * - a URN that matches none binds nothing at all — the endpoint grants nothing — which the page
 *   must say rather than falling back to "every policy of the space" and drawing grants the
 *   gateway would never honour.
 *
 * The space segment is the ContextSpace's `spec.urnSegment` when it pins one, else
 * `{project}-{space}` (`jc_core::kinds::urn_segment`).
