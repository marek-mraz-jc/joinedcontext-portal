/**
 * T-1730: the form contract as one helper, run against every form (UI-04, UI-15, UI-16, UI-44, UI-48).
 *
 * Twenty-eight forms and dialogs, and every defect found in one of them so far was found by
 * hand: a placeholder proposed as a name, focus lost after a refusal, a status code shown where
 * a sentence belongs. Nothing ran one checklist against all of them. `checkForm` is that
 * checklist: a form test of the `ui-forms` group describes its form once and gets every rule.
 *
 * Each rule is a case of its own, so a failure names the rule rather than "the form". A rule
 * runs only when the spec gives it something to work with: a form with no secret field is not
 * asked about secrets, and a form with no cancel is not asked about discarding. The rules that
 * every form has — labels, the empty submit, the refusal, the double click, one primary, axe,
 * the locales, and hostile text coming back as text — always run.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: assert the wording of a label or which request a form sends. Those are
 * the form's own test, and `checkForm` leaves room for it: it returns after cleaning up, so a
 * test calls it and then makes its own cases.
