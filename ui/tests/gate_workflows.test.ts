/**
 * T-2728: every step of every workflow has a live journey and an assistant tool, or names the
 * task that owes it (TS-26, AG-87).
 *
 * `workflow_coverage.json` is the matrix of `Testing/07-workflow-coverage.md` in the docs,
 * machine-read. This gate holds it to the tree: a live journey it names has to exist with that
 * title, a tool it names has to be registered, every mutating route of `openapi.json` has to
 * belong to a step or say why it belongs to none, and the owed entries only ever shrink. A
 * refusal step (no permission, a red verdict, a secret typed in) is a step like any other, so it
 * is gated exactly as the success it refuses.
