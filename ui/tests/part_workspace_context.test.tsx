/**
 * T-1823: the provider that puts the page inside a copy, against the UI contract (UI-15, UI-16).
 *
 * It renders nothing of its own, so the contract here is what it does to everything below it:
 * the copy is known before the first child fetches, entering and leaving read the project again
 * instead of showing what was cached for the other one, and the URL keeps whatever else it held.
 * A page rendered outside it is in the project, never in a copy by accident.
