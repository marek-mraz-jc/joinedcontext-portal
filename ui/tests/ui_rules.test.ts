/**
 * T-1726: the UI rules as one test (UI-01, UI-16, PF-50).
 *
 * `components/ui/index.ts` says "nothing on a page styles a control by hand". This is what
 * enforces it. Each rule reads the sources and fails on every line that breaks it, except the
 * lines `ui_rules.allow.json` already names — today's measured state, which the per-file tasks of
 * the `ui-components`, `ui-forms`, `ui-pages` and `ui-parts` groups empty file by file. The
 * allow-list may only shrink: its totals are asserted, so a new violation cannot be waved through
 * by adding a line to it.
 *
 * The security rules carry no allow-list at all. They are zero today and this keeps them zero.
