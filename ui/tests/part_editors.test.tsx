/**
 * T-1842: the Dashboard and Layer editors, against the UI contract (UI-15, UI-16, UI-11).
 *
 * `dashboard_editors.test.tsx` drives them through the whole page — a map, a legend, a
 * proposal — and owns what they write. This file mounts the two editors on their own, which
 * is what the survey of 2026-09-18 found missing: no axe run covered either dialog, and
 * neither was ever opened in a language other than English.
 *
 * It also owns the state the file had no answer for: a layer whose endpoint is no longer in
 * the project used to open with an empty type list and no filter rows, which reads as a layer
 * with no filter rather than as a layer nobody can finish.
