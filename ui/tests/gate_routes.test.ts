/**
 * T-2136: every route of the Portal is opened by a spec (UI-15, UI-16, TS-19).
 *
 * A page with a test can still be a page nobody opens the way a person opens it. This gate reads
 * `src/router.tsx` and asks two things of every route that renders something: that one mocked
 * Playwright spec under `e2e/` opens it, and that one live journey under `e2e/live/` walks it.
 * What is missing today is in `gate_routes.allow.json` with what covers the page instead, and
 * that list only shrinks.
 *
 * A route that renders nothing because it redirects (UI-28 leaves the Portal no Federation page
 * and no playground) is held to a different rule: a vitest test has to name its address, because
 * the redirect is the whole behaviour.
 *
 * Matching an address to a route takes the most specific route that matches, the way the router
 * does. Without that, `/projects/$project/$plural` would stand in for every page of the Portal.
