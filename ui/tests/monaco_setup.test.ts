/**
 * UI-15, UI-16 (T-2137, OPS-46): the editor is the copy in this bundle, never a CDN's.
 *
 * `@monaco-editor/react` fetches Monaco from jsDelivr unless it is told otherwise. A municipal
 * installation runs behind its own Content Security Policy and sometimes with no route to the
 * public internet at all, so an editor that quietly reaches for a CDN is an editor that never
 * opens there — and, where the route does exist, third-party code on the page that edits the
 * organization's manifests.
