/**
 * T-1549 — UI-44, PF-50, R19: a ScopeDefinition, end to end on dev by a person.
 *
 * Created on the ScopeDefinitions list through its form ("New ScopeDefinition": a name and a path
 * under /admin that only this journey uses; Check, then Propose change), approved, moved to another
 * path through the row's Edit, removed; the assistant opens the same form; a viewer finds the page's
 * write controls disabled with a reason.
 *
 * The path hangs under a node nothing else names, so no Policy grants by it and no entity carries it
 * while it stands.
