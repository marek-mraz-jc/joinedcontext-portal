/**
 * T-3220 — the assistant's administration and the project's settings, as a person who has never
 * filled them meets them on dev. Each form is opened, read and left: nothing is proposed.
 *
 * - A knowledge source: the start address says how a PDF is read, and a cron typed wrong is
 *   refused in words that name the format.
 * - An assistant deployment on a public channel: its origins, rate limit and budget are asked for
 *   at their fields before anything is sent (MF-52), instead of jc-core refusing the proposal.
 * - The project's settings: Edit shows each field's help, as its create form does.
