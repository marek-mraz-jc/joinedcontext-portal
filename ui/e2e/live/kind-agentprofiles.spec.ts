/**
 * T-1536 — UI-44, PF-50, AG-26, AG-47, AG-70: an AgentProfile, end to end on dev by a person.
 *
 * Created on Organization → Agent profiles through its form ("New AgentProfile": a name, the runtime
 * image and its digest, the model and its token budget; a steward profile with the reference limits
 * the form fills; Check, then Propose change) by `demo.steward`, who administers the organization,
 * approved by `demo.approver`, who approves across it; its step limit changed through the row's
 * Edit; removed. The assistant opens the same form; a viewer finds the tab's write controls disabled
 * with a reason.
 *
 * The profile has a name of its own that no run selects (a run loads its profile by name), it is a
 * steward profile that reaches no host, and it grants no access block, so the live assistant's reach
 * does not change while it stands. No key is typed anywhere: the proxy holds those.
