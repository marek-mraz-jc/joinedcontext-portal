/**
 * T-1542 — UI-44, PF-50, DS-09: a DataAgreement, end to end on dev by a person.
 *
 * Created on the DataAgreements list through its routed form ("New DataAgreement": a name, the other
 * participant, the agreement identifier; consumer and requested by default; Check, then Propose
 * change), approved, its state moved to offered through the row's Edit, removed; the assistant opens
 * the same form; a viewer finds the page's write controls disabled with a reason.
 *
 * The agreement is never finalized, so the gateway serves nothing under it while it stands, and the
 * other participant is on example.org (RFC 2606), which nobody runs.
