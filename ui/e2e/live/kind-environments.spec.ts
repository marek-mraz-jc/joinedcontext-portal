/**
 * T-1545 — UI-44, PF-50, CC-73, CC-75: an Environment, end to end on dev by a person.
 *
 * Created on Organization → Environments through its form ("New Environment": a name and the
 * organization's domain there; Check, then Propose change) by `demo.steward`, approved by
 * `demo.approver`, its domain changed through the row's Edit, removed. The assistant opens the same
 * form; a viewer finds the tab's write controls disabled with a reason.
 *
 * An installation renders with the environment its `JC_ENVIRONMENT` names; this one has a name of
 * its own that no installation selects, and its domain is on example.org, so dev renders nothing
 * differently while it stands.
