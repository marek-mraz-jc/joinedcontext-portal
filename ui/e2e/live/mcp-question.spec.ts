/**
 * T-5699, AG-63 — the page where a person decides an AI client's MCP call. A question is the
 * person's own: one that is not open for them (answered, expired, or another person's client
 * asked it) shows what to do next, and their session decides nothing on it. The success path
 * needs a person's own MCP token, which no live account holds; tests/mcp_portal_tests.rs plays it
 * against the real route, and ui/e2e/mcp-elicitation.spec.ts on the page.
