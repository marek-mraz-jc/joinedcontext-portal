/**
 * One kind, end to end on dev, the way a person does it (T-1536…T-1548; UI-44, PF-50).
 *
 * The coverage measurement of 2026-09-18 found kinds named in unit, Rust and assistant tests and
 * in no live journey: a kind nobody ever created, changed and removed on dev by hand is not known
 * to work there. Each `kind-<plural>.spec.ts` hands this module what is particular to its kind —
 * the page a person creates one on and how its form is filled, how one is changed — and gets the
 * same three tests:
 *
 * 1. the steward creates one through the page, the approver approves it, it answers on its route
 *    with a phase that is not an error, one field is changed and approved, and it is removed again
 *    (a Red change the steward approves under the administrator exception of CC-34, as
 *    `removeCompletely` says);
 * 2. the steward asks the assistant to create one and is taken to the kind's form, and nothing is
 *    proposed on their behalf (AG-73);
 * 3. the viewer finds every write control of the kind's page disabled with the verb and the kind
 *    it lacks, and the create call made by hand answers 403 (UI-44, PF-50).
 *
 * What a journey makes is named `t<task>-<HHMM>`, which `residue.spec.ts` sweeps if a run dies
 * half way, and each test cleans up in `finally` whichever way it ends.
