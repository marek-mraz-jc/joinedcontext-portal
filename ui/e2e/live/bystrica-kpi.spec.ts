/**
 * The Banská Bystrica demonstration, walked end to end on dev (T-2309, OPS-46, TS-19).
 *
 * Two public bodies, each ingesting its own published open data into its own Context Space, each
 * computing its own indicators into its own KPI space with its own pipeline, and one application
 * in `bbsk` showing both. The journey opens each space, then the application, and then does the
 * one check a viewer cannot do for themselves: it reads the indicators straight out of each KPI
 * space and asserts the cards show those numbers and no others.
 *
 * Two failures this exists to catch, both invisible on screen:
 *
 * - a card whose number is not the number in the space it names — a dashboard drifting from its
 *   source looks exactly like a dashboard;
 * - a card of one body carrying the other's value. The region has roughly 607 581 inhabitants and
 *   the city 72 123; either number under the other's heading reads as a fact.
