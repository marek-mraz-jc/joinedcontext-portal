/**
 * The published `@joinedcontext/sdk` (SDK-17, AP-11): the entry points a generated
 * application imports, built as ES modules beside their type declarations, with the stylesheet
 * and the tokens copied as they are.
 *
 * A published application is built in CI from its committed project, so the package it installs
 * has to be a library: its own `tsc -b` would otherwise typecheck this checkout's source with
 * this checkout's devDependencies, which a consumer does not have. React and the map and chart
 * libraries stay external — the application pins the same versions and one copy of React is the
 * only copy that works. The type declarations beside them come from `tsconfig.package.json`,
 * because `tsc` already emits them and a plugin for it would be a dependency for nothing.
