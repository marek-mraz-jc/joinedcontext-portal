/**
 * T-0682: `@joinedcontext/sdk` is a package a generated application can install (SDK-17, AP-11).
 *
 * A published application is built in CI from its committed project, with the SDK installed from
 * the organization's forge registry rather than resolved to this checkout. So what the tarball
 * carries is the contract: every `exports` target has to be in it, the entry points have to be
 * built JavaScript with their declarations beside them, and the libraries the application pins
 * itself have to stay outside the bundle — one copy of React is the only copy that works.
 *
 * The build runs here rather than in a fixture because a stale `dist/package` would let the
 * package.json promise a file that the last build never wrote.
