/**
 * The map beside the rows (UI-72): one panel, the same state as the grid.
 *
 * Not a second view of a second query. The panel draws the rows of the page that hold a geometry,
 * a click on a shape activates that row and the active row's shape is drawn as chosen, and in edit
 * mode the geometry of the active row is edited like any other cell — the change lands in the
 * grid's pending edits (UI-67) and is applied through the Endpoint by the same `apply.ts`, with the
 * person's session and the Endpoint's Policy deciding it (EP-55).
 *
 * The drawn area is the one filter the filter row cannot hold: a rectangle becomes `georel=within`
 * on the grid's query and stays visible until it is removed.
