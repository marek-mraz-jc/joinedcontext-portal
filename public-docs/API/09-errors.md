title: Problem Types
description: One section per problem type the platform and the Portal answer with, what happened and what to do; the docs check holds the list to the code.
---

# Problem Types

Every refusal of the platform and of the Portal is an `application/problem+json` document whose `type` is `https://joinedcontext.com/errors/{slug}` ([API/00 §4](00-intro.md#4-standard-error-handling-rfc-7807)). This page has one section per slug, at `09-errors#{slug}`; the Portal links the section from the error it shows. The NGSI-LD surface answers with the ETSI type and puts the slug in `code`.

The list is the code's: jc-core's `PROBLEM_TYPES` and the Portal's `PORTAL_PROBLEM_TYPES`. `scripts/check-docs-against-code.py` fails when a slug in either has no section here, or a section here has no slug (T-4485, TS-19).

## 1. Platform problem types

### `bad-request` {#bad-request}

**Bad Request**, status 400.

The request is not one the service can act on: a parameter is missing, malformed or contradicts another.

What to do: Correct the request as the detail says and send it again.

### `invalid-body` {#invalid-body}

**Invalid Body**, status 400.

The body is not JSON, or not the shape the operation takes.

What to do: Send a JSON body of the documented shape; the detail names what is wrong.

### `urn-scheme` {#urn-scheme}

**Entity Identifier Violates the URN Scheme**, status 400.

An entity id is not an NGSI-LD URN.

What to do: Use an entity id of the form urn:ngsi-ld:{Type}:{id}.

### `quality-rule` {#quality-rule}

**Quality Rule Broken**, status 400.

A value breaks a quality rule its Context Space sets (DM-88), so the write was refused.

What to do: Correct the attribute the detail names: a quality rule of the space refuses its value.

### `reason-required` {#reason-required}

**Reason Required**, status 400.

A delete through an Endpoint names no reason in `JC-Reason` (DM-113, ADR-N-054), so nothing was changed. The gateway asks it of every delete except the Portal UI's own, which follows once the UI sends a reason; DM-113 extends it to corrections and every UI write.

What to do: Send the same request again with a `JC-Reason` header of 1 to 500 characters that says why.

### `unauthorized` {#unauthorized}

**Authentication Required**, status 401.

The request carried no valid token, or a token for another audience, or the session ended.

What to do: Sign in again, or send a valid bearer token for this audience.

### `forbidden` {#forbidden}

**Access Denied by Policy**, status 403.

You are signed in, but no role you hold grants this, or the change touches something outside your grant.

What to do: Ask a project owner or an organization administrator for the role this needs.

### `personal-data-public` {#personal-data-public}

**Personal Data on a Public Endpoint**, status 403.

The Endpoint is public, and its model and projection would serve attributes the model marks as personal data (DM-122, ADR-N-054), so the Endpoint answers nothing until that changes.

What to do: Hide the attributes the detail names in the Endpoint's projection, or narrow its audience.

### `domain-not-verified` {#domain-not-verified}

**Domain Not Verified**, status 403.

The organization's domain is not verified yet, and this needs a verified one.

What to do: Verify the domain in the organization settings first.

### `origin-refused` {#origin-refused}

**Origin Refused**, status 403.

A browser opened the WebSocket from a page of another site.

What to do: Open the WebSocket from a page on the platform's own origin, or from a client that sends no Origin.

### `resource-not-found` {#resource-not-found}

**Resource Not Found**, status 404.

Nothing of that name exists, or it exists and is not shared with you; the answer is the same for both.

What to do: Check the name in the address; it does not exist or is not shared with you.

### `method-not-allowed` {#method-not-allowed}

**Method Not Allowed**, status 405.

The address exists and does not take this method.

What to do: Use one of the methods the Allow header lists.

### `read-only-view` {#read-only-view}

**Read-Only View**, status 405.

The address is a read-only view of an endpoint.

What to do: This view only reads; write through the endpoint it is built on.

### `conflict` {#conflict}

**Conflict**, status 409.

What to do: Read the resource again and repeat the change on its current state.

### `precondition-failed` {#precondition-failed}

**Precondition Failed**, status 412.

The `If-Match` you sent is not the entity's current version.

What to do: Read the entity again and send its current version in If-Match.

### `payload-too-large` {#payload-too-large}

**Payload Too Large**, status 413.

The body or the file is larger than the service takes in one request.

What to do: Send less at once: split the request or the file.

### `unsupported-media-type` {#unsupported-media-type}

**Unsupported Media Type**, status 415.

The body's `Content-Type` is not one the operation reads.

What to do: Send the body as application/json or application/ld+json.

### `upgrade-required` {#upgrade-required}

**Upgrade Required**, status 426.

A plain HTTP request reached an address that only speaks WebSocket.

### `subscription-not-routable` {#subscription-not-routable}

**Subscription Not Routable**, status 501.
