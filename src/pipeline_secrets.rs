//! Resolving a pipeline's `secretRef`s into the runner's environment (T-0927, PL-15…PL-17).
//!
//! A `bento.yaml` names a credential as `${MQTT_PASSWORD}` and nothing else (PL-16), so the
//! value has to be in the runner's own environment by the time the stream runs. Both secret
//! backends have been complete for a while and neither was reached: `jcctl apply` converges
//! through the `Platform` trait and speaks to Kubernetes nowhere, while this process already
//! stages the repository every sync and already writes the objects of an App. So the reconciler
//! resolves them here and writes them into one Secret the runner mounts.
//!
//! Three rules the shape follows, all of them from what goes wrong without them:
//!
//! * **One Secret per runner** (`pipeline-secrets`), because a runner is one pod with one
//!   environment, and a Secret per pipeline would be a mount the deployment cannot know about.
//! * **A clash is a refusal.** Two pipelines naming one `envVar` through different references
//!   would otherwise be served whichever value was written last, and the loser would read a
//!   credential belonging to the other pipeline.
//! * **A reference that does not resolve leaves the stream undeployed**, with the reason on the
//!   Pipeline. A stream that starts without the one credential it needs fails in the runner's
//!   log, where nobody is looking.
