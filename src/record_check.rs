//! One record check for the editor and the proposal gate (T-4840, PL-59, PL-81, GW17): each
//! record a pipeline's sample makes, judged where its write would be judged, before it is
//! proposed. Three sources say why a record would not be written:
//!
//! - `model`: the space's compiled model,
//!   [`ModelSchema::check`](crate::pipeline_validation::ModelSchema::check), the check the
//!   runner's validation stage compiles into its JSON Schema (`pipeline_validation::stage`);
//! - `endpoint`: the gateway's own decision ([`evaluate`] and [`write_guard::check`], the crate
//!   the gateway runs) over the Policies bound to the target Endpoint, the pipeline's own derived
//!   from the draft, then the broker's view of the Endpoint as the reconciler writes it: a write
//!   is admitted only when one rule of the record's type names every Attribute it carries;
//! - `lifetime`: the `expiresAt` the lifetime step wrote (the test runs the step, PL-82), absent
//!   where an entry should have set one, unreadable or already past.
//!
//! The check reads records only; it logs none of them and keeps none.
