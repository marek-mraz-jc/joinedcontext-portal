//! Reading another organisation's schema surface over HTTP (DM-48, DM-49).
//!
//! `jcctl::foreign_models` makes every judgement about what a peer publishes and refuses a
//! plaintext base, a model name that is not a label and a document whose digest does not match
//! the peer's own `index.json`. This is the hop it is handed, and its whole job is to not open
//! a way round any of that:
//!
//! - `https://` only, checked here as well as there, because a redirect is a second URL the
//!   module above never sees;
//! - a public address only, by the rule of [`super::guard`]: a `SharedSpaceReference` is a URL
//!   somebody typed, this runs inside the cluster, and without the rule a peer's schema base
//!   naming `169.254.169.254` or a `*.svc.cluster.local` Service makes the mirror a probe for
//!   whoever can get a reference approved (T-1705);
//! - a redirect is followed only to another public `https://` address, and only a few times;
//! - a timeout per request, so one slow partner cannot hold a reconcile open;
//! - a ceiling on the body, because a peer's `index.json` is a few kilobytes and a mirror that
//!   streams a gigabyte into memory is a peer's denial of service on us.
//!
//! No credential goes out with these requests and none is logged: a schema surface is the
//! public half of an endpoint (EP-46).
