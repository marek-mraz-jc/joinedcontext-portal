//! What authorises a run through the sync webhook route (MF-44, T-2297).
//!
//! `POST /api/v1/webhooks/sync/{project}/{name}` carries no session: the origin proves itself with
//! an HMAC-SHA256 of the request body. That signature covers the body and not the path, so one
//! secret shared between sources would let the origin of any one of them force a run of every
//! other, in projects it has no binding in. Each `SyncSource` therefore names its own, as
//! `spec.webhook.secretRef`, and the reconciler resolves it on each pass and holds it here.
//!
//! **Why it is held rather than resolved per request.** The door is unauthenticated until the
//! signature verifies, and resolving a reference means reading the repository this sync staged —
//! a tree fetched over the forge API. A resolution per request would hand an unauthenticated
//! caller a repository fetch per request, which is a worse door than the one this closes.
//!
//! The value never leaves this module: callers ask [`Accepted::verifies`], which answers yes or
//! no. A source the last pass resolved nothing for accepts nothing, and that is the same answer
//! as a bad signature — the route says `401` to both, so it tells nobody which sources exist
//! (PF-59, R20).
