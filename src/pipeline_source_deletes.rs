//! A snapshot pipeline follows what its source removed (PL-97, PL-100, T-4891).
//!
//! The runner's outcome sink tells the Portal every id a run wrote; for a pipeline whose
//! `spec.sourceDeletes.mode` is `snapshot` each id goes into the pipeline's source ledger with the
//! run that read it. When the run queue sees a run end, [`run_ended`] judges it: a run that did not
//! finish, failed on a record or read nothing deletes nothing and counts as no miss; a complete run
//! adds a miss to every ledger id it did not read and clears the misses of the ones it did. The ids
//! missing from `misses` complete runs in a row are deleted, unless they are more than `maxShare`
//! of the ledger: then nothing goes, the run is held and the pipeline's subscribers are alerted
//! until a person with `approve` on Pipeline releases or keeps them.
//!
//! The Portal never deletes itself. It hands the runner a one-shot stream that deletes the ids
//! through the pipeline's output Endpoint as the pipeline's own account, with the reason in
//! `JC-Reason`, so the gateway judges, audits and tombstones every delete like a write (DM-115);
//! the stream reports what went back here and only those rows leave the ledger.
//!
//! An `events` pipeline (PL-98, T-5360) feeds the same ledger. Its stream reads `deletedWhen` on
//! each mapped record and posts the ids it marked to [`marked_at_source`]; only ids in the ledger
//! are kept, and they go in one delete stream when the run ends, or every [`SWEEP`] for a pipeline
//! that waits for pushes and has no runs. Before any delete the stream reads each entity's
//! `modifiedAt`: one someone changed after the pipeline last wrote it stays and is reported
//! (PL-100).
