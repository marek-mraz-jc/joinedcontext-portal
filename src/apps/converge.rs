//! Putting what [`crate::apps::reconciler::render`] compiles onto the cluster (T-0411, AP-13,
//! AP-13a, AP-18, AP-21, AP-27).
//!
//! Rendering is a pure function; this is the half with a side effect. One App manifest becomes
//! four server-side applied objects, a retired one becomes four deletions, and everything else
//! is a documented skip rather than a silent nothing. Nothing is written to the realm: the
//! login front is the edge's one `edge` client, so an app has no OIDC client of its own
//! (AP-27, ADR-N-019).
//!
//! Two properties make a second run cheap and safe. Server-side apply is idempotent by
//! construction, so an unchanged app converges to no change at the API server. And the one
//! endpoint slug is the one the App's committed Endpoint carries (T-2632), or, for an App
//! committed before its grants were, the one read back from the Secret, so a second run does not
//! move the app's endpoint (EP-02).
//!
//! One app's failure never stops another's: the loop reports per app and keeps going, because a
//! single broken manifest should not freeze every other app on the cluster.
