//! Compiling `kind: App` into what runs it and what it may read (T-0227, AP-04, AP-05,
//! AP-25…AP-29, AP-13, AP-15, ADR-N-019).
//!
//! An app declares needs, never grants: `spec.dataNeeds` is the input, one `Endpoint` and one
//! `Policy` per need is the output, and the app reaches context data through nothing else
//! (AP-04). The pod-shaped half is the second half of the same idea: the app container is the
//! pod's only container, reachable from the APISIX edge alone, and the edge's `openid-connect`
//! plugin is the login front, so the application carries no authentication code at all (AP-26,
//! ADR-N-019).
//!
//! Rendering is a pure function of the manifest, the installation settings, the image CI built
//! and the reconciler-owned endpoint slug — spelled out because `apps/mod.rs` also documents
//! `pub mod reconciler;` from the outside, and rustdoc resolves the two doc blocks merged, in
//! the parent scope, where a bare name here is not an item. Nothing here reaches a cluster:
//! `render` returns the objects, and applying them is the caller's business.
