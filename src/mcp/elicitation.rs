//! The question a Yellow or Red MCP call asks before it runs (AG-63, T-0836).
//!
//! An agent may propose and may ask to remove, but it may not decide alone: a call whose
//! operation takes the Yellow or the Red lane, or carries `destructiveHint`, answers an
//! elicitation first. The host shows it to the person, the person opens the Portal page the
//! question names and decides there with their own session, and the client repeats the call
//! naming the question. Only then does the operation run, and the answer is written to the
//! project's activity, so what a person allowed is on the record (AG-56).
//!
//! The decision is the Portal's record, never the client's word (T-5699): a client holding the
//! person's token could otherwise accept its own question without anyone seeing it. The second
//! call's `action` can only decline; it never accepts.
//!
//! The route is one stateless POST, so the elicitation cannot be a server→client request on an
//! open stream: it is the answer to the first call and an argument of the second. What that
//! costs is one extra round trip; what it buys is that the words the person saw and the call
//! that runs are the same call, bound by id, subject and arguments.
