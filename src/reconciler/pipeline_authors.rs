//! A pipeline keeps only the reach of its people (PL-95, T-4917): at each render the reconciler
//! re-asks PL-94 ([`crate::pipeline_rights::missing`]) for the person who last proposed the
//! Pipeline and the one who approved it, and a reference either of them lost holds the pipeline
//! out of the runner with the reason `author lost access to {reference}`. `spec.enabled` stays
//! as the manifest says; a proposal by a person who holds the rights brings it back.
//!
//! Both people are read from the commit that brought the manifest to the default branch, as the
//! approval wrote it ("Approved in the Portal by …", "Proposed in the Portal by …"). A commit the
//! Portal did not write names nobody and is not judged here: whoever pushed it held the forge's
//! own write. Bindings and `Group` manifests come from the mirror; with the realm's admin client
//! the person's realm groups and roles count too, the bootstrap group included.
//!
//! The forge is asked once per manifest content (two calls), [`LOOKUPS_AT_ONCE`] Pipelines at a
//! time. A path the forge has no commit for is remembered with the ref it was asked at, so an
//! unchanged revision asks nothing again (T-5292: ~640 lookups, ~23 s, on every run before).
