//! The open-data catalogue, brought to what the repository declares (EP-62…EP-67, T-2405).
//!
//! The publisher itself is `jcctl::publish::ckan`: it builds the dataset from the Endpoint's own
//! DCAT-AP record, the resources from the representations it enables, and the optional sheet from
//! its tabular answer. Until now nothing drove it inside the platform, so a dataset appeared when
//! somebody ran `jcctl publish ckan` from a shell and a withdrawn publication stayed in the
//! catalogue until somebody noticed. EP-62 asks the reconciler to do it, which is this wave.
//!
//! Three rules, each from what goes wrong without it:
//!
//! - **The token is resolved per run and never held.** It comes from the instance's `apiTokenRef`
//!   the way the publisher's own command resolves it — the variable the reference names, else the
//!   repository's encrypted secrets under this Portal's age identity — lives in the HTTP client for
//!   the length of one publication, and is in no outcome, no status and no log line (EP-67, CC-06).
//! - **Only what the platform published is ever withdrawn.** A dataset somebody created in
//!   CKAN by hand, or a harvest wrote, is not this reconciler's to delete, so a withdrawal needs
//!   the Endpoint that declared it to have been there a run ago, exactly as the subscription wave
//!   decides its deletions (CC-19), or the dataset to carry jcctl's own `generated_by` mark in an
//!   organization the current Endpoints publish into (T-4461).
//! - **One Endpoint's failure is not the run's.** A catalogue that is down, a record the gateway
//!   will not serve, a reference that does not resolve: each is one outcome with its reason, and
//!   the next Endpoint is still published.
//!
//! - **An Endpoint is published when it is due, never every tick (T-4717).** Republishing every
//!   dataset each sync came to about 1,000 requests a minute through the public edge, the edge
//!   answered 429, and each refusal was retried on the next tick. So an unchanged Endpoint is
//!   published again only after [`REFRESH`], a failed one backs off, and the calls of a run to
//!   the catalogue keep [`CALL_GAP`] apart.
//! - **The catalogue is asked about an organization once a pass, on its Service (T-5314).** Every
//!   publication asked `organization_show` through the public edge: 184 calls in two minutes for
//!   one organization on prod, against the public's own limit. A pass remembers each organization
//!   it saw ([`Organizations`]), and the deployment's own catalogue is called at the in-cluster
//!   address the operator maps its public URL to ([`CkanSync::reaching`]).
//!
//! Everything CKAN is spoken to through `jcctl`'s blocking client, so each publication runs on a
//! blocking thread: dropping a blocking `reqwest` client inside the reconciler's runtime panics.
