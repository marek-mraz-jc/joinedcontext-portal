//! Every `MqttBroker`'s release and Keycloak client (ADR-N-048 §2.6–§2.7, MF-54, PL-74, T-3994).
//!
//! The deployment renders the broker chart once with sentinels into the ConfigMap
//! [`TEMPLATE`] (key `objects.yaml`) in the brokers' namespace. Per broker the reconciler fills
//! the sentinels and applies every object by server-side apply, the way the App hosts copy the
//! edge Ingress, so the chart stays the one description of a broker. The names it fills are DNS
//! labels and the limits numbers, so a filled value can never open a sentinel or a YAML structure
//! of its own.
//!
//! A manifest the platform refuses (its kind's rules, a ServiceAccount its project does not
//! declare, a broker past the project's MQTT allowance, a dedicated port another broker holds) is not applied: the release it had keeps
//! running, and the error goes into the broker's status. A broker whose manifest is gone loses its
//! objects, and its client `mqtt-{project}-{name}`: bearer-only, no secret, the audience the
//! gateway checks a device's token against. The ServiceAccounts a broker's roles name get that
//! audience on their own clients (`workload_clients`).
