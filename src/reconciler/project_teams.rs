//! The forge teams of every project repository (PF-87, T-2655).
//!
//! Each registered project of layout 2 has two teams in the forge organization,
//! `{slug}-readers` (read) and `{slug}-writers` (write), each reaching that project's repository
//! and no other. Who is in them is Keycloak's: the groups of the same names, which
//! [`super::groups`] fills from the project's bindings, and the forge's group→team mapping. This
//! wave keeps the teams themselves: it creates them, takes away any other repository a team was
//! given, and removes the teams of a project that is gone.
//!
//! A team this wave made says so in its description. A team of the same name without that
//! description belongs to whoever made it and is never written or removed.
