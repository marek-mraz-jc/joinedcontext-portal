//! A Live stream that takes records in and lands none (T-2967, T-2961).
//!
//! The runner's counters are cumulative, so one scrape cannot tell a stream that stopped
//! writing from one that wrote a lot once: hsl-hfp-vehicles read about 35 messages a second
//! for half an hour with `sent`, `rejected` and `errors` frozen, and its status said Live. This
//! keeps, per stream, the written count and the instant it last moved; when `received` has grown
//! since then and nothing was sent, rejected or failed for [`WINDOW`], the stream is stalled.
//!
//! A quiet source is not a stall: `received` standing still says the source sent nothing. A
//! runner that restarted counts from zero again, which starts the watch over. Everything lives
//! in this process: a Portal that restarts watches for another window before it says anything.
