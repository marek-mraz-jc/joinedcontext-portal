//! source's sample, the mapping tried on it and the records checked against the target space's
//! model. The workbench calls them through `POST /api/v1/projects/{project}/ops/{name}`, MCP and
//! the assistant through the registry, so a person, an agent and the assistant see the same
//! output for the same input. The fourth step, the save, is `jc_resource_propose`.
//!
//! Nothing here writes: the sample and the mapping run as the throwaway harness stream of a
//! pipeline test (PL-43, MF-38) and resolve no `secretRef`; a streaming source's sample is its
//! saved input, whose credential only the runner fills (T-4841). The check is the one the
//! runner's validation stage renders (PL-60).
