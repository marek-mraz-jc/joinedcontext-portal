//! The decision page of a broker's MCP write (T-5829, Antares T-5816): an Antares started with
//! `ANTARES_MCP_CONFIRM_URL` sends the person here instead of trusting the AI client's own
//! accept. The Portal reads the question from the broker with its admin token and records the
//! decision there in the name of the person signed in, so only the person who asked decides it.
//!
//! The id names no space, so every broker the Portal reaches is asked. The broker answers its
//! question to anyone holding the admin token; the Portal shows it only to the subject whose call
//! asked, and every other person gets the same 404 as an unknown id.
