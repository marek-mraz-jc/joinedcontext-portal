//! What a `SyncSource` reports and what an operator can do to it (MF-28, MF-30).
//!
//! The manifest itself is served by the generic resource routes like every other kind; this is
//! the running loop around it — the phase, the revision it carries, the merge request it is
//! waiting on, and the three buttons the project page offers.
//!
//! The three differ in what they touch, which is the whole reason there are three:
//!
//! - **Sync now** runs the loop once, whatever the schedule says. It changes nothing but the
//!   run's memory, and what it produces is a merge request like any other run's.
//! - **Pause** switches the loop off. It is an operator's decision about a running process, not
//!   a change to the repository, so it is recorded beside the run's memory and no merge
//!   request is opened for it.
//! - **Detach** stops syncing for good, and that *is* a change to the repository: the manifest
//!   goes away, so the change is proposed and reviewed like every other one (CC-03). The
//!   resources the source brought in stay where they are — detaching a source is not deleting
//!   what it published.
//!
//! The webhook route lives here too. A source with `schedule: { webhook: true }` runs when its
//! origin says it moved, and the caller proves themselves with an HMAC-SHA256 signature over the
//! request body — against **that source's own** secret, `spec.webhook.secretRef`, which the
//! reconciler resolves each pass and leaves in [`crate::sync::webhook_secrets`] (MF-44, T-2297).
//! The signature covers the body and not the path, so one shared secret would have let the origin
//! of any source force a run of every other; and an unauthenticated trigger would be a way for
//! anybody on the internet to make the Portal fetch a remote repository as often as they liked.
