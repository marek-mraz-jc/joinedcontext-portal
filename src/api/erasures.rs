//! A data subject's rights in a space (API/01 §46, DM-124, DM-126, DM-127, T-4668): the export of
//! every Entity naming the subject with its history, and the erasure that reaches every copy.
//!
//! The space's owner runs them (`approve` on its ContextSpace). The subject's value travels in the
//! request body, never in a URL an access log keeps; the log holds its keyed hash only. Every
//! call needs a `reason` and is audited with it.
//!
//! An erasure takes four eyes (DM-142, T-5356): the request is a proposal, and another person with
//! `approve` on the ContextSpace approves it by typing the subject again, or either owner declines
//! it. A bearer token never decides one.
