//! The caller's roles in one published application, for its backend (AP-109, Architecture/16
//! §13).
//!
//! A `fullstack` backend never sees the static host that writes `#jc-config` (AP-95), so it asks
//! here with the edge's `X-Access-Token` as `Authorization: Bearer`: a token of the App's own
//! client `app-{name}`, whose `resource_access.app-{name}.roles` are the caller's roles, as AP-92
//! reads them for the static host. Nothing else the caller sends counts. The answer is about the
//! caller alone and names no other resource, so it needs no `read` on the project: an
//! `organization` App admits people who hold no rule in it.
