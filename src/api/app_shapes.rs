//! `POST /api/v1/projects/{project}/apps/rename-shapes` (AP-124, API/01 §12b, T-2940).

//! For one release `static` and `fullstack` are read as `ui` and `ui-rust`. A project's Apps
//! page offers one click that rewrites every App still written with an old name, as one Change
//! in the clicking person's name (owner decision 2026-10-06). Each rewritten App passes the
//! single-manifest door first, as a dry run, so the refusals, the permission and the lane are the
//! ones a form would meet; then the files go out together through the forge half of an import.
