//! A space's retention as the broker runs it (DM-85, ADR-N-046): what a draft of
//! `spec.retention` would delete now, before an owner saves it, and what the sweeps deleted.
//!
//! The rules themselves are the space manifest's, saved through the manifest routes, where only
//! an owner changes them (`spaces::check_retention`). These two routes read the broker through
//! the reconciler's writer, which knows the type IRIs it writes the rules under.
