//! The internal listener (AG-52): every route the credential proxy, the agent runner, the pipeline
//! runner and the gateway call back on, and nothing else. It is served on its own port with no
//! session layer and no CSRF guard, so each handler authenticates its caller's bearer through
//! `crate::auth::internal` before it reads anything. A `/internal/` route lives here and nowhere
//! else, so a handler cannot be added to the wrong listener by being written in the wrong file.
