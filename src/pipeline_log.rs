//! A pipeline's runs and the log of each (PL-62, ADR-N-034).
//!
//! The runner sends one outcome line per record through a sink that drops rather than retries:
//! `sent` once the gateway took the record's batch, `rejected` when the validation stage refused
//! it, `failed` when one of the author's steps threw. A run is one tick of the pipeline's clock,
//! or one UTC hour for a source that never ends; the runner names it.
//!
//! Bounded per pipeline: the newest [`LINES_KEPT`] lines and the newest [`RUNS_KEPT`] runs. A
//! run's counts are kept apart from its lines, so a run of 4000 records still says 4000 after
//! most of its lines have aged out. Record ids and messages are masked before they are stored:
//! an id is whatever the mapping produced, and a message can quote the source.
