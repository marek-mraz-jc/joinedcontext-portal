//! Who may call the Portal's internal listener (PF-46, AG-52; docs Architecture/13 §6).
//!
//! The listener is not on the public URL scheme and a NetworkPolicy admits one workload to its
//! port. That is the second control, never the only one: a pod that reaches the port through a
//! policy mistake must still present the identity the route belongs to. CLAUDE.md's rule is the
//! whole of this module — "every workload via a `ServiceAccount` client with audience-bound
//! tokens; no static keys between cluster services".
//!
//! One check, one place, and a client per route (T-2271): the gateway reads the preview list, the
//! credential proxy answers the run callbacks, the project's pipeline runner posts a test capture.
//! A token for one of those opens that route and no other, because the check compares `azp` and not
//! only the audience — the audience says "this listener", the client says "this door".
