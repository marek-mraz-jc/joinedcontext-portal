//! Attack vector T-1686 (MF-05, MF-04, AP-11): mass assignment and unknown fields.
//!
//! Every field a caller sends is a field somebody chose to accept. `status` is the platform's own
//! computation, `metadata` has six members and no seventh, a Change's lane is classified from the
//! manifest and never read from the body, and an approver is the session. These cases send each of
//! them anyway.
//!
//! What the existing suites already play, so this file does not repeat it:
//! `mutate::tests` (the envelope's own `deny_unknown_fields` and the `status` refusal of MF-04),
//! `edge_change_lane_tests` (a lane is classified from the kind and the spec, with no body in
//! sight), `changes_tests::approve_self_approval_returns_403_and_makes_no_git_mutations` (who the
//! approver is, is the session). What was left is the sweep: the same five smuggled members
//! against the doors a person actually posts to.
