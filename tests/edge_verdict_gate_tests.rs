//! Edge cases of the verdict gate and the listing it feeds (T-2119, T-2121 – T-2127; PF-57, AG-62).
//!
//! **The contract, in one sentence:** a proposal passes only on a verdict that is green, recorded in
//! this project, and taken of **this exact manifest** — and on a strict installation nothing else
//! passes, whoever asks and however the manifest is spelled.
//!
//! The gate is the one place where "somebody checked this" is remembered
//! (`src/ops/mod.rs:1130-1300`). A verdict accepted for the wrong manifest is a manifest that reaches
//! a Change without anyone having seen what it does; a verdict readable across people is a check one
//! person can do for another's import. So the cases below aim at the binding — manifest, project,
//! person — and at what the refusal says, which travels to a client through the MCP door as well as
//! the REST one.
//!
//! Tests only (the family's rule). Every case here is green; a red one becomes its own task.
