//! Edge cases of the operation registry's gate (T-2113 – T-2118; AG-11, AG-59, AG-70, PF-50, PF-59).
//!
//! Six functions of `src/ops/mod.rs` decide, for every action the Portal offers, whether this caller
//! may take it. They are the only gate the assistant, MCP, the UI and the REST door share, so a hole
//! in one of them is a hole in all four surfaces at once. The contract each must hold:
//!
//! - `Via::touched_kind` (line 66) — four arrivals, four distinct words, and they are written into a
//!   draft's history, so they are a contract with the UI and with whoever reads an audit trail.
//! - `Caller::grants` (line 107) — the profile's half of an agent run: it only ever narrows, and a
//!   refusal names the operation asked for and nothing else of the profile or the person.
//! - `Caller::may_run` (line 123) — what no profile can grant (AG-11) is refused before the profile
//!   is consulted at all (AG-70), so the reason a person reads is the true one.
//! - `serde_error_path_and_message` (line 252) — covered in the module's own tests, because it is
//!   `pub(crate)`.
//! - `call` (line 277) — the order: the caller's half, then the person's half, then the input, then
//!   the body. An input is never even parsed for a caller who may not run the operation, and the
//!   body never runs for one the gate refused.
//! - `permitted` (line 295) — the person's half, exactly as the REST route of the same action
//!   decides it; a read of a project the caller cannot see is 404 and a write is 403 (PF-59, R20).
//!
//! Tests only (the family's rule). Every case is green; a red one becomes its own task. The cases
//! sweep `ops::registry()` rather than naming operations, so an operation added tomorrow is held to
//! the same contract without anybody remembering to add it here.
