//! Edge cases of the approval lane a change is put in (T-2109; CC-19, CC-39, CC-63, PF-52, PF-62).
//!
//! **The contract, in one sentence:** `change::classify` may err towards the stricter lane and never
//! towards the looser one — a deletion is Red whatever it deletes, a kind that can hand out access or
//! reach another organisation is Red whatever its spec holds, and anything the function has not been
//! taught is Yellow rather than Green.
//!
//! The lane is not cosmetic: it decides how many approvals a change needs and who may give them
//! (`src/api/changes.rs`), so a manifest that lands one lane lower is a manifest that merges with
//! less review than the architecture requires. Every caller hands the function a kind from the
//! catalogue and that manifest's own `spec`
//! (`src/api/mutate.rs:857`, `src/api/delete.rs:264`, `src/api/import.rs:1494`,
//! `src/api/blueprints.rs:314`, `src/agents/share.rs:207`); the one caller that passes `Null`
//! (`src/api/changes.rs:594`) is a lower bound by design, combined with the headline manifest's own
//! lane through `riskiest`, so a spec-dependent lane is never decided from an absent spec.
//!
//! Tests only (the family's rule). Every case is green; a red one becomes its own task.
