//! Portal, and a model that never stops calling.
//!
//! Every case here drives the real conversation loop with a stubbed model proxy, so a defence
//! that is switched off shows up as a tool event that should not exist. The suite needs no
//! cluster: the mirror, the drafts and the model are in this process.
