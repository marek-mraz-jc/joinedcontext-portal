//! Attack vector: an MCP client or an agent run reaches an operation a person must perform
//! (T-1689; AG-11, AG-82, AG-45, AG-70, AG-77, PF-58).
//!
//! **The attack.** Arrive as `Via::Mcp` and as `Via::Agent` and take, by name, the operations the
//! platform reserves for a person: approve a change, reject one, delete a resource, delete a
//! project, bring a workspace back, throw one away, and answer the question a run asked (a service
//! account's keys were on this list until there were none to mint, T-4616). Name them even where
//! the caller's profile does not, and name them where the widest profile an author could write
//! does.
//!
//! **The defence.** Each is refused on the caller and the operation alone — before the profile is
//! consulted, before the input is read and before the body runs — with the reason that says whose
//! the act is. Two of them are not refused and must not be: proposing a deletion is an agent's
//! to do (AG-77), because a deletion is a Red Change that a person still approves. The vector's
//! property is that nothing is decided, not that nothing is asked for.
//!
//! What the existing tests already play, read before this file was written:
//!
//! - `ops_registry_tests.rs::a_change_is_never_decided_over_mcp_or_by_an_agent` — approve and
//!   reject, over MCP and as a run, refused with the AG-11 reason.
//! - `workspace_api_tests.rs::an_agent_or_an_mcp_client_never_brings_a_workspace_back` and
//!   `::an_agent_or_an_mcp_client_never_throws_a_workspace_away` — the two ways out of a workspace.
//! - `workspace_api_tests.rs::the_listing_an_agent_reads_offers_the_work_and_neither_way_out` —
//!   the workspace half of the listing.
//! - `edge_ops_gate_tests.rs::no_profile_however_wide_lets_a_run_decide_a_change_or_move_a_workspace`
//!   — the widest profile over those same four.
//! - `ops_registry_tests.rs::the_run_operations_answer_and_an_agent_is_refused_by_name` — create,
//!   cancel and publish as a run, and that a person's own MCP session is not stopped by that gate.
//!
//! What was left, and is this file: the run's answer (refused nowhere the listing could see, so
//! `GET …/ops` and `tools/list` offered a run an operation it would always be denied — fixed in
//! `src/ops/mod.rs::may_run`), the reason a refused answer reads (one sentence about runs, which
//! told a reader nothing), the two proposals that are deliberately open, and the evidence that a
//! refused call writes, fetches and echoes nothing.
