//! Attack vector T-1683 (PF-57): the check is made on one value and the action taken on another.
//!
//! The step this file exists for is the third one: **approve a Change whose branch moved after
//! review**. The approval used to read every file of the merge request at the branch *name* and
//! then ask the forge to merge that branch *name* — two reads of a moving target. A push landing
//! between them merged content nobody checked, past every per-file rule `approve_every_file`
//! walks. Now one commit decides both: the review reads the commit the forge reported and the
//! merge is pinned to it, so the forge itself refuses a branch that has moved.
//!
//! What the existing suites already play, so this file does not repeat it:
//! `mutate::tests::propose_validation_rejects_foreign_namespace_and_fills_absent` and
//! `::propose_rejects_name_mismatch_on_replace` (a body whose `metadata.name`/`namespace` differs
//! from the path — the path wins or the request is refused),
//! `edge_verdict_gate_tests::only_a_green_verdict_of_this_exact_manifest_in_this_project_opens_the_gate`
//! and `strict_gate_tests::a_changed_or_refused_manifest_is_not_proposed_on_an_earlier_check` (a
//! Verdict binds the digest of the body it checked, so a draft swapped after its Verdict is
//! refused), `ops::verdict::tests::digest_is_order_independent` (the digest itself).
