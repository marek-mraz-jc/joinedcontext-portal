//! T-1709 — "a copy or a preview as a way around review": the bring-back as an attack
//! (PF-82, PF-83, CC-81).
//!
//! **The attack.** A workspace is a copy of the configuration that nobody reviews while it is
//! being written, so the way around review is to put the risky manifest inside the copy and
//! bring the copy back as a change that looks small: a grant edited among a sandbox space's
//! fields, or a grant removed altogether. The defence is that the bring-back is not a merge but
//! a proposal: every file of the branch is classified again, the riskiest one decides the lane
//! the approval enforces (CC-63, CC-79), and every file is checked against the rights the person
//! has *now*, not the ones they had when they wrote it (PF-82).
//!
//! What the rest of the vector is played by, so these cases do not repeat it:
//! `workspace_propose_tests.rs` (the write inside a copy takes the same checks — viewer, quota,
//! secret, own rights), `workspace_security_tests.rs` (whose copy a person may read),
//! `edge_workspace_routes_tests.rs` (only the owner brings one back, another project's is not
//! there), `workspace_preview_tests.rs` and `workspace_reaper_tests.rs` (a preview serves only
//! its own project, an expired copy is served to nobody and loses its branch),
//! `internal_listener_tests.rs` (`/internal/previews` answers the gateway's own token alone),
//! `preview_tests.rs` in the platform (a preview never takes over a slug or a space of `main`).
