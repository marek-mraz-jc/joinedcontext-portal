//! Edge cases of the seven workspace routes (T-2046 … T-2052; PF-51, PF-57, PF-59, AG-59, R20,
//! API/01 §22).
//!
//! **The contract, in one sentence:** a workspace is opened by somebody who may propose in the project,
//! seen by whoever may read what it covers, and changed, brought back or thrown away by nobody but its
//! owner — so a caller who may not see one is told it is not there, and a request that could not be
//! honoured is refused before a branch is cut.
//!
//! The happy paths live in `workspace_api_tests.rs` (open, list, read, compare, update, propose,
//! discard), the visibility rules in `workspace_security_tests.rs` (who sees whose) and the writes
//! inside a workspace in `workspace_propose_tests.rs`. This file is what those leave: the bounds of the
//! opening request, the order the checks run in, and the two places where the name of a workspace in
//! another project comes back to a caller who may not read that project.
//!
//! Tests only (the family's rule). Every case here is green; a red one becomes its own task.
