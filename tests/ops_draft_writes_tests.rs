//! `jc_draft_put` through every door of the registry (T-1535, T-2482; AG-64, PF-50, AG-61, CC-76).
//!
//! What was there before this file: `mcp_portal_tests.rs` and `attack_assistant_tests.rs` name
//! `jc_draft_put` on their happy paths, and the store's own unit test in src/ops/drafts.rs refuses
//! a literal secret and a stale version. No test asserted a refusal through the operation, and none
//! wrote into a workspace that was not the caller's. That one was open (T-2482): the draft
//! operations used the workspace as a key and never asked whose it was.
